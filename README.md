========

Currently, Japanese, English and Korean editions are available. You can get the various formats; pdf, mobi, epub, and html (automatically updated every time the source is updated) at:

>Remark 1: Ian Y. Choi (ian@naimnetworks.com) worked Korean edition from Japanese edition using Google translator (http://translate.google.com).

>Remark 2: The Korean PDF file has linefeed problems for source codes. It is because of inproper tex configuration. I am figuring out this bug, but it is a little bit difficult for me to solve.. (Please give me some advice if you are familiar with ko.tex and this problem.)
