The first relase of Chinese version is made by SDN team of Institute for Information Industry in Taiwan.

Welcome to join us to help Chinese readers to more understand about Ryu.

The Chinese version now support HTML, EPUB and PDF format.
You can use "make html" to get the HTML file or "make epub" to get EPUB file.
Of course you can use "make latexpdfzh" to get Chinese version pdf file.

Because using LaTeX to PDF generated by sphinx do not support Chinese by default.
You need XeLaTeX installed to replace pdfLaTeX beofre you get the PDF file. 
(if you install MacTeX on MAC OS then XeLaTeX will be installed by default)

Please follow the step below to get Chinese PDF file.
1. install XeLateX.
2. edit source/conf.py to change the setting of Chinese fonts depend on your environment.
    % english fonts
    \setmainfont{Apple LiGothic Medium}
    % Chinese fonts
    \setCJKmainfont{Apple LiGothic Medium}
    \setCJKmonofont{Apple LiGothic Medium}
    \setCJKsansfont{Apple LiGothic Medium}
    \setCJKfamilyfont{APPLE}{Apple LiGothic}
